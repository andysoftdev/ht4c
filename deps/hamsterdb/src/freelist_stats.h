 * represents slot size = 1 alignment, 1 represents size of 2 * 32,
 * 2 ~ 4 * 32, and so on.
 *
 * EDIT:
 * In order to cut down on statistics management cost due to overhead
 * caused by having to keep up with the latest for VERY large sizes, we
 * cut this number down to support sizes up to a maximum size of 64Kb ~
 * 2^16, meaning any requests for more than 64Kb/CHUNKSIZE bytes is

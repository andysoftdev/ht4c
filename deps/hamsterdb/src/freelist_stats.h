 * As we [can] support record sizes up to 4Gb, at least theoretically,
 * we can express this size range as a spanning aligned size range:
 * 1..N, where N = log2(4Gb) - log2(alignment). As we happen to know
 * alignment == 32, at least for all regular hamsterdb builds, our
 * biggest power-of-2 for the freelist slot count ~ 32-5 = 27, where 0
 * represents slot size = 1 alignment, 1 represents size of 2 * 32,
 * 2 ~ 4 * 32, and so on.
 *
 * EDIT:
 * In order to cut down on statistics management cost due to overhead
 * caused by having to keep up with the latest for VERY large sizes, we
 * cut this number down to support sizes up to a maximum size of 64Kb ~
 * 2^16, meaning any requests for more than 64Kb/CHUNKSIZE bytes is
 * sharing their statistics.
